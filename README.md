# üîê ESP32-ESP8266 Fault Injection Attack

This project demonstrates a **hardware-based voltage glitching attack** using an ESP32 to bypass authentication on an ESP8266 by momentarily disturbing its power supply at precise moments ‚Äî simulating real-world fault injection exploits.

## üß† Project Overview

| Component      | Role                       |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| **ESP8266**    | Victim ‚Äî runs password-check logic |
| **ESP32**      | Attacker ‚Äî injects glitches via GPIO |
| **Laptop**     | Monitors UART output and controls logic |

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- 1 √ó ESP32 Dev Board
- 1 √ó ESP8266 NodeMCU (or equivalent)
- Common GND connection
- Jumper Wires

## üîå Wiring

| ESP32 (Attacker) | ESP8266 (Victim) |
|------------------|------------------|
| GPIO (Glitch)    | VCC / EN pin     |
| GND              | GND              |

**Note**: Use a common ground between both devices.

## üß™ How It Works

1. ESP8266 waits for a password input.
2. ESP32 triggers a power glitch at a precise time.
3. This disrupts a conditional check inside the ESP8266 firmware.
4. If the glitch is timed right, authentication is bypassed.

**Basic Setup:**
- ESP32 controls the glitch via a GPIO pin
- That pin is connected to the **EN pin** or **VCC** line of the ESP8266 (use a series resistor for safety)
- Common ground between ESP32 and ESP8266
- Serial connections for monitoring both boards independently

## üîÑ Working
https://youtu.be/4pfjF2fE4OM
1. **Startup:**
   - ESP8266 initializes and waits for a password over Serial
   - ESP32 is idle until triggered

2. **Trigger:**
   - ESP8266 reaches password check stage
   - ESP32 either listens for a specific signal or delays for a precise window

3. **Fault Injection:**
   - ESP32 sends a fast LOW pulse to the EN or VCC of ESP8266
   - This temporarily browns out the CPU without a full reboot

4. **Result:**
   - If the glitch is timed right, ESP8266 skips or corrupts the password check logic
   - Serial shows access granted without correct password

## üßæ Serial Output

- Victim and attacker both output logs over USB serial.
- Use baud rate: `9600` or `115200` (depending on code)
- Use any serial monitor (Arduino IDE, PuTTY, minicom)
